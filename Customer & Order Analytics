#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
Select Distinct acctnum, orderdate, orderid
From Bit_DB.customers
Inner Join Bit_DB.FebSales
On Bit_DB.customers.order_id = Bit_DB.FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
Select Distinct Product, Price
From Bit_DB.JanSales
Order by Price Limit 1;

#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue
,product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product;

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
Select Product, Quantity, Sum(quantity)*price as revenue, location
From Bit_DB.FebSales
Where location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
Select Count(distinct cust.acctnum), Round(Avg(quantity * price), 1) as average_spend
From Bit_DB.customers cust
Left Join Bit_DB.FebSales Feb
On cust.order_id = Feb.orderID
Where Quantity > 2
And length(Quantity) <= 6
And orderid <> 'Order ID';
